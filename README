# Pre-requisites: #
###################

	1) Make sure your VM has at least 8GB of RAM as there will be a lot of services running.
	
	2) Log in to Ambari and make sure HBase and Storm are running. On a pristine Sandbox they are off. 
	
	3) Put Falcon in Maintenance mode and then stop its services. This stops Falcon but, more importantly, stops the embedded
	ActiveMQ server that is packaged with Falcon so some standard ActiveMQ ports are freed. You can redirect Falcon to use
	the standalone ActiveMQ server if needed by following the instructions in the Additional Notes section below.
	
	4) Forward ports 8081, 8161, 60010 and 61616 from host to VM.

# Demo Setup steps: # 
#####################

1) scp the zip archive to your VM
	scp -P 2222 /<path to zip archive>/storm_demo.zip root@127.0.0.1:~
2) ssh into the VM and unzip storm_demo.zip	
3) Change directories into the storm_demo folder
	cd storm_demo
4) Install and start Kafka:
	./setup/bin/install_kafka.sh
5) Install and start ActiveMQ:
	./setup/bin/install_activemq.sh
6) Install Maven:
	./setup/bin/install_maven.sh
	- Refresh you environment:
		source ~/.bashrc 
	- Verify installation worked by executing mvn -version
7) Run the demo setup script to build all modules and deploy the storm topology and the webapp. This will take a while (5-10 minutes with good connection) 
   as Maven grabs all of the dependencies. Enjoy a nice cup of coffee.
	./setup/bin/setup_demo.sh
8) Start the demo
	./setup/bin/start_demo.sh
9) When you see: "[INFO] Started Jetty Server" then you can navigate your web browser to: http://localhost:8081/storm-demo-web-app/index.html
10) When you are done you can kill the jetty server with ctrl-c and then stop the other demo components
	./setup/bin/stop_demo.sh

# Additional notes: # 
#####################

If you would like to utilize Falcon in the same cluster then you must configure Falcon to use the standalone ActiveMQ as opposed
to the embedded server that Falcon is packaged with. To do this (source: https://blogs.apache.org/falcon/): 

1) Disable start of activemq in falcon server start script edit "bin/falcon-start" script and add FALCON_OPTS="-Dfalcon.embeddedmq=false"
2) In startup.properties of falcon server add your own activemq url
	- *.broker.url=tcp://sandbox.hortonworks.com:61616
